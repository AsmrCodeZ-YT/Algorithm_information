## A* : (A STAR)

A* algorithm is like a superhero of pathfinding algorithms! It's fast, efficient, and smart! It combines two powerful metrics, cost and heuristic, to find the shortest path like a boss. However, just like any superhero, it has its kryptonite. If we use a lousy heuristic function, this bad boy may lead us to suboptimal paths. And if we encounter complex obstacles on the way, A* algorithm may get stuck and lose its way like a clueless tourist. So, to make the most out of this algorithm, we need to be smart, choose the rig4euristic function, and design an efficient system to handle obstacles and co4xitie4
